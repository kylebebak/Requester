# 2.25.0

## New Features

Requester's Test Runner now supports **custom validation functions**, which allow you to make assertions about any aspect of response object using anything Python has to offer.

This is a feature I've wanted to add for a long time. I hope you all like the implementation. Check out the docs to see how it works.

Also, Export to cURL now supports basic authentication.
