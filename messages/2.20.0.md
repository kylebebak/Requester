# 2.20.0

## New Features

Response tab name: if parsed URL has no `path`, display `netloc` (base path), instead of displaying nothing.

Also, the default length of response tab names is limit to 32 characters. You can change this limit in settings.

## Bug Fixes

Fixed bug in saving requests back to requester file when paging through request history.
