# 2.36.0

## New Features

Adds **Requester: Open Request History File** and **Requester: Move Requester File** commands.

The first opens the request history file in a read-only view, and the second moves a requester file to a new path and updates request history for all requests sent from this file.

Also, request history now persists **combined** env string to history file, which means any request can be re-sent even if original requester file is no longer present.

Internal: further improves and simplifies code for computing env and saving to request history file.
