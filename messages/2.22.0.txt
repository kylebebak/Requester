# New Features
Requests in history are now keyed for uniqueness on `(request_string, requester_file)`, instead of just `request_string`, if the requester file exists.

Also, a request can be deleted from request history by pressing `ctrl+alt+backspace` in the request's history tab.

Finally, there are several improvements to file downloads:

- downloads don't require a '/' suffix for Requester to automatically assign the file a name
- downloads correctly resolve the '~' char to the user's home directory
- downloads from URLs with a trailing query string get the correct file extension
