# 2.8.0

## New Features

Improvement to request chaining: users can "name" response to requests and reference those responses by name in subsequently executed requests.

Added `fmt` argument to requests, which controls JSON response formatting. It can be one of one of ('raw', 'indent', 'indent_sort').

Improved syntax highlighting for response views with no valid content type in response headers.

## Code

Reorganized project so that command files, and syntax files, each have their own directory. All command files are loaded by top-level `requester.py` module.
