# 2.28.0

## New Features

Single requests that don't start at the first character of a line can be parsed correctly. This allows you, for example, to execute requests that have been commented out, or requests that are in doc strings, or requests in a markdown list.

Place your cursor on the first line of either of these requests and attempt to execute them.
