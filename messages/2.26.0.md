# 2.26.0

## New Features

Requester requests support a new keyword argument, **tabname**, that allows you to specify a custom response tab name for a request. This response tab can only be overwritten by requests with the same **tabname**.

This is useful for differentiating requests whose method and URL are the same but whose meaning is different. GraphQL requests, whose meaning is encoded in the query string, are one example.
