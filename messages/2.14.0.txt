# New Features
More good news! Like 2.13.0, this release introduces a number of improvements to Requester.

- File downloads whose path has no `basename` get an automatically generated filename. If the filename is already take, a new unique filename is generated.
  + Also removed a subtle bug in downloads.

- Requests defined over multiple lines are much easier to execute. You can place cursor anywhere on the first line of a multi-line request and run it without highlighting anything.

- Requester has a new option to "explore" URLs returned in the response body of a request. Highlight a URL in a response tab and press `ctrl+e` (`cmd+e` on macOS) to send a GET request to the highlighted URL.
  + If the URL has the same domain as the URL for the original request, the rest of the request args will are left unchanged, which means that the new request will be trivially authenticated.
  + If the URL has a different domain, the remaining args are removed from the new request.

# Bug Fixes
- Requests executed from a requester file pull in the current values for all env vars in this file, __even if the file has not yet been saved__.
