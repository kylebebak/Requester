## Request parsing

For request parsing errors with non-empty selections, retry parsing with empty selection starting at `region.begin()`.

This improves ergonomics, for example when navigating through requests in a requester files using fuzzy match.

Try highlighting the first 4, 5, 6, 7... characters of this request and then execute it:

get('google.com')

This works for multi-line requests as well. Try highlighting "get(" on the first line, then executing the request.

get(
'google.com'
)
