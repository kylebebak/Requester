# 2.18.0

## New Features

Serious GraphQL support! Requester can autocomplete any GraphQL query from a response tab.

- Autocomplete provides field type, name, and arguments, similar to [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).
- Enable autocomplete by installing `graphql-py` using `pip`, see documentation for extending Requester.

As far as I know, Requester make Sublime Text the first text editor with reliable GraphQL support!
