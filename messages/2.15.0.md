# 2.15.0

## New Features

Requester's on fire! Request history has been totally revamped for this version, combining fuzzy search with paging for request history nirvana.

### Request History

If you run **Requester: Request History** from the command palette (add this to your key bindings, the command is "requester_history"), you get the usual fuzzy searchable list of requests. But now, if you select one of these requests and hit Enter, Requester doesn't execute the request.

Instead, it "stages" the request into a "request history" tab, from which you can look at the request and edit it before you execute it. And if you press `ctrl+alt+ ←/→`, you can page between requests that were executed before and after this historical request.

You can actually start paging through past requests from any open response tab.

Being able to stage requests before executing them is a big help for requests that aren't idempotent, like POST requests... Before you had to execute them to even see them.

And paging combined with search makes it trivial to find past requests. If it's a recent request, just start paging backwards. If it was a week ago, and you know it was one of many you executed against the Twitter API, fuzzy search for "twitter" to land in the general neighborhood, then page around to find the exact one you're looking for.

### Little Improvements

- Ergonomics for basic GET requests: parser handles URLs with or without wrapping quotes.
