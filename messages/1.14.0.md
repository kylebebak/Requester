# 1.14.0

## New Features

Added command to **pin/unpin** response tabs.

Unpinned response tabs are overwritten by requests with the same method and URL. Pinned response tabs are not, which makes it possible to have multiple views open for the same request.

To pin/unpin a response tab, hit `cmd+t` on OSX, or `ctrl+t` on Linux/Windows.
