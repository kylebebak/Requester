# 2.17.0

## New Features

- Added basic GraphQL support

  - `gql`, `gqlv`, and `gqlo` kwargs to automatically add GraphQL queries to querystring for GET requests, and to JSON encoded request body for POST requests.
  - GraphQL autosuggest coming soon!

- Added `browsercookie` auth option for grabbing Chrome/Firefox cookies and adding them to requests, similar to Postman's Interceptor.
  - Added information on importing Python libraries that depend on shared objects, like `pycyrpto`.

## Bug Fixes

Extending Requester: no longer writes writes same `packages_path` to `sys.path` multiple times.
