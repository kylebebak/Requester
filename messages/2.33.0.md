# 2.33.0

## New Features

Awesome news! I decided to vendor all of Requester's deps, which means you can import `requests_oauthlib` and `requests_toolbelt` in your env block without any mucking around with pip.

It also means that Requester does graphql query autocompletion out of the box.

Requests was also upgraded from 2.15.1 to 2.18.3, which is the last version of the package that supports Python 3.3, the version of Python run by Sublime Text.

For those interested in package development, I'm also working some tooling to make it easy to vendor dependencies for Sublime Text packages. Given the limitations of Package Control, vendoring deps is, as Will Bond says [here](https://github.com/wbond/package_control/issues/825), the "one true approach".

Also fixes a bug in request parsing that was caused by a breaking change in Sublime Text's default Python syntax.
